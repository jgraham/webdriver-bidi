# WebDriver BiDi

WebDriver BiDi is a proposed bidirectional protocol for browser automation,
building on and extending [WebDriver](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/).

WebDriver BiDi is not ready. Here's what we have so far:
- An [explainer](./explainer.md) with more background and goals
- Detailed [proposals](./proposals/) for the initial protocol
- A [unofficial spec draft](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver-bidi/) waiting to be fleshed out
